Last-Mile Delivery Intelligence Platform
Product Overview
An AI-powered delivery optimization platform that predicts accurate ETAs, detects delivery anomalies in real-time, and provides actionable recommendations to reduce failed deliveries and improve on-time performance for last-mile logistics operations.
Target Customers
Primary:

Quick commerce platforms (Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart)
Regional courier services and local delivery fleets
Third-party logistics providers (3PLs)

Secondary:

D2C brands with in-house delivery
Hyperlocal delivery startups
Food delivery platforms

Core Problem Statement
Delivery operations lose 20-30% efficiency due to:

Inaccurate ETA predictions leading to customer dissatisfaction
Failed deliveries costing â‚¹50-100 per retry
Poor visibility into real-time delivery exceptions
Reactive (not predictive) operations management
Manual route planning and driver assignment

Product Features
1. Smart ETA Prediction Engine

Real-time ETA calculations using ML models trained on:

Historical GPS traces and delivery patterns
Live traffic conditions and road network data
Weather, events, and area-specific delays
Courier performance history


Accuracy: Within 3-5 minute windows for 85%+ deliveries
Dynamic updates: ETAs recalculate every 30 seconds based on actual progress

2. Delivery Anomaly Detection

Predictive failure alerts identifying high-risk deliveries before they fail:

Courier running late beyond recovery threshold
GPS deviation from optimal route
Prolonged stops at delivery locations
Address ambiguity or accessibility issues


Root cause classification: Traffic, address issues, courier behavior, customer unavailability

3. Intelligent Reassignment Recommendations

Auto-suggest nearby couriers for at-risk deliveries
Load balancing across delivery partners based on capacity and location
Priority routing for time-sensitive orders (quick commerce)

4. Customer Communication Module

Automated SMS/Push notifications with live tracking links
Proactive delay alerts with revised ETAs
Delivery instructions capture (gate codes, landmarks)
Feedback loop post-delivery for quality monitoring

5. Operations Dashboard

Real-time heatmap showing:

Delay hotspots and congestion zones
Courier locations and status
Exception alerts requiring intervention


Performance analytics:

On-time delivery rate by zone/courier/time
Failed delivery trends and reasons
ETA accuracy metrics


Historical reporting for capacity planning

6. Route Optimization (Addon)

Multi-stop route planning minimizing distance and time
Sequence optimization considering time windows
Dynamic rerouting based on new order assignments

Technical Architecture
Data Inputs

GPS traces from delivery apps/devices
Order metadata (pickup/dropoff, time windows, item type)
Road network and traffic APIs (Google Maps, Mapbox, TomTom)
Historical delivery performance data
Weather and events data

ML Models

ETA Prediction: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) or Graph Neural Networks for spatial-temporal forecasting
Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, LSTM autoencoders for sequence anomalies
Reassignment Optimization: Constraint-based matching algorithms

Integration

RESTful API for ETA queries and webhook events
SDK for mobile/web apps (Android, iOS, JavaScript)
Webhooks for real-time alerts to ops teams (Slack, WhatsApp, email)
Data connectors for popular delivery management systems
